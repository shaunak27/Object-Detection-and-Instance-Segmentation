Comparative Study of Various CNN architectures as backbones for Mask RCNN model

This repository contains 8 different Mask rcnn models and evaluation codes written in PyTorch packed in .ipynb files recommended to be run on Google Colab.
In any modelname.ipynb file, the 'modelname' has been used as a backbone for the Mask RCNN model proposed by Kaiming He, Georgia Gkioxari, Piotr Doll ÃÅar, and Ross Girshick. Mask R-CNN. In ICCV, 2017.
The dataset used for training and testing is the Penn-Fudan Pedestrian Detection Dataset.
Use the 'Open in Colab' Chrome Extension to directly open these notebooks in Google Colab.
